            <h2 id="subtitle"> Suffolk Sheep breeders listing & info</h2>
            <p> 
                The Suffolk was developed in the early 1800's in the southeastern area of England
                 by crossing the Southdown and the Norfolk Horned sheep. The breed came to Canada 
                 in 1888 and interest in the breed grew rapidly after 1920. More than eighty years
                later it is still one of the dominant breeds in the Canadian industry. Because 
                Suffolk lambs exceed all other breeds in rate of gain, and respond well to confinement, 
                they offer excellent economic returns and continue to dominate the heavy lamb market in Canada.

                The rams are widely used as terminal sires in commercial ewe flocks due to their ability to produce lambs with excellent growth and carcass traits. The Suffolk is, however, a heavy feeder and maintaining a moderate size sheep under more controlled management systems has been advantageous in exploiting their meat traits in an economically efficient manner.

                    <h3>Breed Standard</h3>
                    <p>
                        Suffolk sheep have several characteristics that make it unique. One of these is their ears, which are bell-shaped, and often hang pointed downward.

                        This is a strong and muscular sheep breed. Even the ewes are well-muscled. They aren’t as muscular as the rams, however, and the latter have much larger body mass and volume than females do.

                <li>
                    <h3>Face and Head </h3>
                    <p>
                        Black hair with a fine texture covers the Suffolk sheep’s head. There isn’t any wool on the head, both at the cheeks and poll. When you look at this sheep’s head, you notice it has an oblong shape. The Suffolk breed standard discriminates against sheep considered excessively coarse-headed or too refined. This will vary by whether the sheep is a ram or ewe. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Legs and Feet</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Suffolk sheep has a wide appearance when you see it from behind. The animal should have a long stride, and it should be graceful and confident. The sheep’s toes should be consistent in size, and the heel should be deep-set. The Suffolk sheep has jet black hooves. The legs should not be excessively coarse nor refined in terms of bone size. 
                    </p>
